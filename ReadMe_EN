# Identify Fraud from Enron Financial Data

## Project summary

Apply machine learning  building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset. On a dataset of 146 employees, based on a hand-generated list of persons of interest in the fraud case (indicted individuals, others who reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity) to identify if there are any other persons of interest (potentially participated in fraud).

Algorithms used: SVC, GaussianNB, DecisionTreeClassifier within AdaBoostClassifier and KNeighborsClassifier

## Included files explanation:

poi_id.py： The main file of the project. Includes the data cleaning, and classifier training code.

na_count.py： A supplementary file that helps to identify the NA values for every feature and its visualization.

tester.py： File prepared from the online course the project was part of. Helps to get the results for the classifier created.

feature_format.py： A file that helps to turn a python dictionary to a sk-learn friendly format
